HTML::Summary
=============

Description
-----------

The HTML::Summary module produces summaries from the textual content of
web pages. It does so using the location heuristic, which determines the value
of a given sentence based on its position and status within the document; for
example, headings, section titles and opening paragraph sentences may be
favoured over other textual content. A LENGTH option can be used to restrict
the length of the summary produced.

This distribution contains the HTML::Summary module, and some supporting
modules. The full list of modules is:

HTML::Summary
Text::Sentence
Lingua::JA::Jcode
Lingua::JA::Jtruncate

I have bundled these modules together because this is an early release, and I
am still open to suggestions on changes to the structure / interface.

The HTML::Summary module provides the ability to generate summaries of HTML
pages.
