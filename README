HTML::Summary
=============

Description
-----------

This distribution contains the HTML::Summary module, and some supporting
modules. The full list of modules is:

HTML::Summary
Text::Sentence
Lingua::JA::Jcode
Lingua::JA::Jtruncate

I have bundled these modules together because this is an early release, and I
am still open to suggestions on changes to the structure / interface.

The HTML::Summary module provides the ability to
generate summaries of HTML pages. The install process is fairly standard:
